					Robotic systems, in particular, rely heavily on these algorithms to perform tasks efficiently and effectively.  A Planning algorithm is responsible for generating a sequence of actions that enable the system to achieve a specific goal. 
					This algorithm takes into account the current state of the environment, the system's capabilities and limitations, and any obstacles or constraints that may hinder the execution of the desired task. Planning algorithms use techniques such as search, 
					optimization, and decision-making to identify the best course of action.  Once a plan has been generated, it needs to be executed in a Control algorithm. The Control algorithm is responsible for ensuring that the system executes the actions in the plan accurately and efficiently. 
					It does this by continuously monitoring the system's performance and making necessary adjustments to ensure that the execution of the plan is optimal. Control algorithms rely on feedback from sensors and actuators to make these adjustments.  
					One common type of Planning and Control algorithm is the Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. This algorithm uses a dynamic model of the system to predict its behavior over time and generate a sequence of control inputs that optimize a specific objective. 
					MPC algorithms are widely used in the fields of robotics, automotive control, and process control. </p>
				
					<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align:justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Another important Planning and Control algorithm is the Path Planning algorithm. This algorithm is responsible for generating a collision-free path for a system to follow from its current position to a desired position. 
					Path Planning algorithms use techniques such as A* search, potential fields, and sampling-based methods to identify the best path through the environment. </p>
					
					<p style="margin-bottom: 15px; text-align:justify">&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;In summary, Planning and Control algorithms are fundamental components of autonomous systems that enable them to achieve specific goals by generating a sequence of actions and ensuring their accurate and efficient execution. 
					These algorithms use techniques such as search, optimization, and decision-making to identify the best course of action and rely on feedback from sensors and actuators to make necessary adjustments.</p>
